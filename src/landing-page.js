This tailored approach optimizes team performance at every stage of development.</p>
<p>I have successfully overseen a team of five members directly at a leading Swiss nutrition company and directly managed an Area Sales Manager at a global food company in Hong Kong. Additionally, I have managed approximately 300 indirect distributor staff across Asia.</p>
<p>My passion lies in cultivating robust, sustainable, and mutually beneficial relationships with both internal and external stakeholders. This dedication ensures that accounts remain optimized and profitable, contributing to the overall success of the organization.</p>

This initiative involved a dynamic response to identified white-spots in sales, profit, and new product launches. One of the key strategic enhancements was the professionalization of distributor management, a move that significantly augmented numeric distribution and amplified brand activation. Concurrently, I instituted a standard monthly reporting system, facilitating a more robust oversight of performance metrics.
